The impression we usually have of a poacher is a forward who stays at the front of the attacking line, excels at positioning, has strong finishing ability, but doesn't pass much and has a limited coverage range. For example, Haaland at Manchester City is playing like a poacher. However, the data comparison between Kane (a player we describe as striker with playmaker element) and Ronaldo may surprise you:

From the chart above, we can see that Ronaldo's average shots per game are slightly higher than Kane's, at the same time, Ronaldo's average passes per game are also significantly higher than Kane's. You may think that the midfield of Juventus in 20/21 and Manchester United in 21/22 was not performing well, which led to Ronaldo frequently coming back to give more options for the midfield. However, in the 22/23 season, after the signing of Eriksen and Casemiro, Ronaldo's average passes per game are still significantly higher than Kane's (Ronaldo 20.9:16.6 Kane). Moreover, Ronaldo is also superior to Kane in average assists and key passes (before the 21-22 season).  Indeed, passing and shooting are the most intuitive indicators to reflect a player's attacking performance, but these data are relatively simplistic and cannot be used to analyze a player in detail. Therefore, let's take a look at more nuanced data to see what information it can provide:

We can see that although Ronaldo has made more passes than Kane, his passes were mainly short passes and he rarely tried to pass forward. That is to say, after dropping back to the midfield, Ronaldo's main aim was to provide more passing options. When he got the ball, he would choose to pass it back or passed it to a nearby teammate before running back to the front line. This kind of playing style will make his average number of shots and passes looked good, and his heat map will show a large coverage area, but it was hard to say that he has made a significant contribution to the team's build up in attacking. Obviously, we cannot make a qualitative judgment about this playing style, but it gives the impression that Ronaldo is not very involved in the team's attacking play. This is also reflected in the two statistics introduced in recent years: Shot Creating Actions (SCA) and Goal Creating Actions (GCA), which can be understood as contributions to shots/goals; most of the SCA/GCA come from passing. SCA/GCA not only considers the last pass (direct assist) but also considers the second-last or even the third-last pass to weaken the importance of assists and increase the importance of build up from midfield. It is precisely in these two statistics that Ronaldo is slightly worse than Kane (SCA: Ronaldo 2.27 - 2.62 Kane, GCA: Ronaldo 0.15 - 0.47 Kane).

In the game, as a center forward, Kane would try more forward passes, connecting the midfield and the front line, and undertook some of the task of switching the play. This made his proportion of forward passes higher and the proportion of short passes lower. Similarly, because Kane had the ability to hold the ball and challenged defenders in the penalty area, his participation in attacking is higher. Kane's playing style is similar to Benzema, and if we say Rashford is a slightly weaker Ronaldo, it is easy to explain why Manchester United wants to buy Kane in the coming summer. Back to the topic, in recent years, Ronaldo has clearly leaned towards being a poacher, reducing his dribbling frequency and distance, and focusing more on scoring or attracting defenders before making a simple pass to assist his teammates. Of course, this article is not intended to belittle Ronaldo. If you think that calling Ronaldo a poacher is belittling him, then you need to ask yourself if you already think Ronaldo is not as good as other forwards. Regardless of what type of forward he is, as long as he can score goals, he is a good forward (or a forward who creates goals).
