In the match against Everton, Rashford was substituted due to a groin injury in the final stages, while in the Europa League game against Seville, the starting center-back duo of Lindelof and Varane also had to be substituted due to injuries. Suddenly, the issue of Ten Hag's lack of rotation became the focal point of criticism from fans, and the media also questioned him about his rotation policy. So, is it true that Ten Hag doesn't rotate at all, or is it because the team failed to win the match...? To explore this, let's compare Manchester United's rotation in the past two seasons and the rotation patterns of the current top four teams in this season:

Up to the match against Seville, Manchester United has played a total of 50 games this season. There are 5 players (including both starters and substitutes) who have made more than 40 appearances this season, and the same 5 players have also played more than 3000 minutes; the number of appearances and minutes played align for these players. Only Bruno Fernandes has played more than 4000 minutes, while the rest of the players have had a '90s'* ranging from around 30 to 40 (minutes played / 90). In the 2021/2022 season, Manchester United played a total of 50 games across all competitions, and similar to the 2022/2023 season, Bruno Fernandes had the highest number of appearances and minutes played. The 90s appearances for other key players was below 36. However, it is worth noting that in the complete 2020/2021 season under Solskjar, Manchester United played a total of 62 games, with 3 players making over 50 appearances. It was the season with the least rotation among the past three seasons.


In fact, this season, apart from the ironman Bruno Fernandes, most of the key players have been subject to varying degrees of rotation. For example, Rashford and Lindelof have made a combined total of 39 and 38 appearances, respectively. For a top-four team with European competition commitments, such playing time is not uncommon, and a top club's key players, as well as the medical teams, should possess the capabilities to cope with midweek fixtures.

As a comparison, let's take a look at the rotation situation of the other three current top-four teams this season, where Arteta has also been criticized for rotation issues. Arsenal has played a total of 42 games across all competitions this season, and there are 4 players who have made over 40 appearances, with their playing time exceeding 3000 minutes. The rotation intensity for key players is indeed relatively low. Newcastle's situation can be described as even more extreme than Arsenal. They have played 39 games this season, and 8 players have made at least 33 appearances. There is a significant gap in the combined number of appearances. Of course, Newcastle has fewer matches, so it's understandable that key players have been consistently on the field. Manchester City, on the other hand, has clearly done the best job in terms of rotation. Although a total of 12 players have made at least 35 appearances (around 35), only one player has played more than 3500 minutes. This is thanks to their possession-based tactics and excellent attacking ability, which allows them to secure a lead early in many matches and give their key players rest.

To provide a clearer comparison of the team's rotation, I have selected the playing time data for the top 25% players in Manchester United over the past three seasons and the other three top-four teams this season. As shown in the graph, if the values for "Total" and "Played" are closer, it indicates a lower rotation intensity because a similar number of appearances implies less rotation when the total number of matches is the same. Similarly, smaller values for "Total" or "Played" indicate less rotation (playing full matches).

From the graph, we can see that Manchester United's rotation this season is actually not far off from Manchester City, and it is noticeably better than Newcastle and Arsenal. The reason for not rotating players as much as Manchester City is likely due to the significant gap between the first-choice players and the substitutes, as well as a lack of attacking prowess to secure an early lead. For a first-year coach, it may be better to keep the first-choice players on the field and secure three points rather than risking dropping points by substituting them. As for the perception that Ten Hag doesn't rotate at all, I believe it may be attributed to the following points:

1.Reluctance to use youth academy players. Although Mason Greenwood has been given many opportunities, players like Zidane Iqbal have spent more than ten matches on the bench without getting a minute of playing time.

2.Core players getting injured in less important matches. For example, Eriksson's injury during the match against Reading, which caused him to be absent for over two months, and not substituting Rashford in the Everton game, which led to his groin injury.

3.When the team doesn't win, there is a need to find reasons (vent frustrations), and it conveniently becomes an issue of not rotating players.

Some may argue that injuries to Eriksson and Casemiro's suspension make the data look better. However, I believe injuries and suspensions are part of a season, and Manchester United has faced varying degrees of injuries in previous seasons, just like other teams. Furthermore, the absence of two key players increased the playing time of McTominay and Fred (included in the statistics in the final graph), which is simply a case of one player benefiting from another's absence.
